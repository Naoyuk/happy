# Happy

Happy is an app that you write down the things you will have felt happy.

## How to use

Post a happy thing you found in the day.  
You can see only your happy. This is not SNS. You don't share them.
So you can focus to your real happy. They are not decorated for showing off.

## Date setting

Your posts are separated by each day.
So your local time zone is important.
Set your time zone in 'Edit Profile' first.


## Stars

Stars mean that how many happy posts have you done the day.
Goal is 3 stars!
